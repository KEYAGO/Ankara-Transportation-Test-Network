# Ankara-Transportation-Test-Network

Ankara, the capital of Türkiye, is a metropolitan city with a population of approximately 6 million. Several main arteries connect east-west and north-south directions in the city. There are two ring roads surrounding them. These ring roads are connected to motorways and national roads to accommodate trips outside Ankara. Considering the mentioned features, Ankara's transport network is a highly efficient and multidimensional network for transport planners and traffic engineers. Consequently, a test network project has been developed in order to utilise this network in various studies. In the “Ankara Transportation Test Network” project, the major intersections and arteries of the city were simplified with a geometric drawing, the length information of the links was obtained from Google, free flow travel times were calculated with the average free flow speed logic and thus a test network was formed. As a result "Ankara Transportation Test Network" consists of 44 Nodes and 132 Links.
